1.) Run Installation-Script

If it fails, create just the database by hand (phpmyadmin) and grant the rights to access it via:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON datenjahr.* TO 'root'@'192.168.8.6' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass''word';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

After that, run the installation script again – now it should be able to create all tables necessary!

2.) After the db-installation is done, create categories.

A category can be:

	a.) KPI – Showing a tile with monthly average value and monthly trend
	b.) Fixed-Cost – Showing up in the fixed-cost-distribution-chart

3.) Now insert your fixed costs via selecting the category and setting the amount for it

4.) Insert Monthly Expenditures and Revenues based on your categories
